# Script to delete broken links.
#
# The script:
# - Includes a `--dry-run` option to print links to be deleted instead of deleting them
# - Uses `rm -f` to force deletion of links without prompting for confirmation
# - Asks the user to confirm deletion for each link, with options "yes", "no", or "all"
# - If the user chooses "all", the script deletes the current link and all remaining links without asking for further confirmation
