# When writing or creating a markdown document, follow these guidelines

- Most documents must have a document title - a level one heading and should\
  ideally be the same as the file name.
- The title must be followed by a short intro of 1 to 3 lines.
- The rest of the headings must start from level 2.
- Generally omit a TOC from your document and rely on the rendering context to\
  provide one. You may make an exception to this rule in order to provide\
  smaller, inline TOCs which enumerate only the items within a given section of\
  the document, as a means of introducing what comes next.
- Markdown elements in your document should be separated by exactly one blank line.
- Obey projects' character line limit wherever possible. Long URLs and tables\
  are the usual suspects when breaking the rule. (Headings also can't be\
  wrapped, but we encourage keeping them short). Unless instructed otherwise,\
  wrap your text to 120 characters. Often, inserting a newline before a long\
  link preserves readability while minimizing the overflow.
- To create paragraphs, use a single blank line to separate one or more lines\
  of text. Don't indent the first line of a paragraph unless it part of a list.
- Don't use trailing whitespace, use a trailing backslash. Best practice is to\
  avoid the need for a `<br />` altogether.
- Use ATX-style headings. Prefer a single space after # and newlines before\
  and after.
- Use double asterisks for bold text. Avoid using double underscores for bold\
  text, as it's harder to distinguish from italics at a glance.
- Use single underscores for italics. Avoid using single asterisks for\
  italicized text.
- Use dashes for bulleted lists.
- Use lazy numbering for long lists.
- Use consistent indentation. When nesting lists, use a 2 space indent for\
  both numbered and bulleted lists.
